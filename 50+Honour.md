Challenge yourself on beta kata, and VOTE
Kata are in beta while they are still being vetted by the community. When you complete them, you earn 3 extra honor, in addition to the kata's normal ranked honor.
You can now vote on these kata and provide feedback to help authors correct any issues and perfect them for primetime. And if you want quick access to beta kata, you can set your default Catalog view to "Beta" in your preferences!
